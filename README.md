## Problem Statement
How might League of Legend players find ways to enhance their skills so that that they can experience positive gameplay while fostering meaningful relationships within the League of Legends playerbase?

## Research
83% of American adults have experienced harassment in online multiplayer games. 71% of the harassment qualifies as "severe abuse" including phyiscal threats, stalking, and sustained harassment. User interviews conducted by our team determined that users wanted a way to find other people to play with and potentially create a friendship through the shared activity. In addition, we found out that players get harassed because of their "poor" skill level.
