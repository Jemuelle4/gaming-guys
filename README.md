## Problem Statement
How might League of Legend players find ways to enhance their skills so that that they can experience positive gameplay while fostering meaningful relationships within the League of Legends playerbase?

## Research
83% of American adults have experienced harassment in online multiplayer games. 71% of the harassment qualifies as "severe abuse" including phyiscal threats, stalking, and sustained harassment. User interviews conducted by our team determined that users wanted a way to find other people to play with and potentially create a friendship through the shared activity. In addition, we found out that players get harassed because of their "poor" skill level. 

## User Persona
Natasha Romanoff, College freshman

### Pain Points
- Frequently harassed (skill-based taunting, sexist comments) when playing multiplayer games
- Toxic environment affects her ability to improve her skills i ngame

### Goals
- Improve gaming skills to avoid harassment
- Find teammates that are respectful


## Major Next Steps
### Implement Chat Feature
Once two users connect, allow a chat function to be used between the two. Minimum functionality consist of just between the two matched players, but additional feature may be added where a user can create a group chat and have more than two people communicate through that chat to form a team. 

### Implement rating system and/or report feature
To minimize abuse and harassment within the app, implement a rating system where users can rate interactions between other people. A report feature will also be a good feature to add, where the team will review the chat (if implemented) on a case by case basis. Please be aware of certain biases and problems a rating system will have. Targetted reviews towards certain gender, race, and identities can be coordinated and provide harassment. Do more research how this implementation can reduce biases. 

### Implement system to encourage players to be a guide/mentor
What's in it for people to teach other players? Brainstorm ways to motivate users to be guide/mentor.

### Expand app to serve different competetive multiplayer games such as Dota, Fortnite, Heroes of the Storm.
